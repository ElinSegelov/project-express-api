# Project Express API

During Thechnigo Bootcamp week 13 our assignment is to build a restful API using Express. The API had to have at least two endpoints, one showing a collection of data and one showing only one element.

## The problem

Using a json-file with data from Netflix, I first created a few endpoints using both queries and params, specific for title, release year, and country. Then I re-worked the code so I could use the same code for any query. If I had more time, I'd implement the possiblity to filter data with several keys, using the generic query, and also make some documentation for the API.

## View it live
